# Training-app

## Introduction

App for personal trainers which allows them to track their clients progress. Written in Flutter, uses Provider as a state management solution. This was my first Flutter project which I built to understand basics of Flutter and Provider.

## Features

- Adding and managing clients and their personal data
- Designing and modifying workout programs for clients (including sets, reps/time ranges)
- Workouts log for each client (sets, reps/time, weight) - workouts based on workout programs with ability to modify (such as additional sets)
- Taking and storing clients' body measurements (bodyweight, bodyfat, circumferences)
- Statistics for each client (completed workouts, workouts per week etc.)

## Launch

If you want to launch the app, you can download training_app.apk file from apk folder and install it on your device.
